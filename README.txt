A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/mca62511/pen/bpbQeB.

 Another FreeCodeCamp project. This time the task was to produce something that can search for Wikipedia articles and give suggestions as you type. Because I love Google's design aesthetic, I tried to make it look a bit like the Google Keep interface.
